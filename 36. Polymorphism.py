# Polymorphism : Greek words that means to have many forms or faces.
#                Poly = Many
#                Morphene = Forms

# Two ways to achieve polymorhism
#           1. Inheritance = An object could be treated of same type as a parent class
#           2. "Duck Typing" = Object must have necessary attributes/methods
